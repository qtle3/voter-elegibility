# Voter Eligibility Checker

This program determines if a person is eligible to vote in the US elections. It takes input from the user to assess the following criteria:

1. **Citizenship**: Checks if the user is a US citizen.
2. **Age**: Confirms if the user is at least 18 years old.
3. **State Residency**: Verifies if the user meets their state's residency requirements.
4. **Felony Status**: Asks if the user is a convicted felon, as this may affect eligibility.
5. **Registration**: Asks if the user is registered to vote.
Based on these inputs, the program will inform the user whether they can vote.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Conditional Statements**: Used to evaluate multiple criteria for voter eligibility.
- **User Input**: Gathers necessary information from the user to make decisions.
- **Basic Control Flow**: Implements a simple flow to guide the user through the eligibility check.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `vote.py` script using Python 3.x.
